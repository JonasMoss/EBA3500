## Unbiased estimators

*Note:*: Dekking et al. claims that unbiasedness is *desireable*. I disagree, it's almost always irrelevant, and what matters are measures such as the mean squared error, introduced in the next lecture.

**Uses the Poisson process again! Damn.**

## Estimators
**Definition.** Estimator and estimate.

1. When is one estimator better than another?
2. Can we find "the best" estimator?

**Definition: Sampling distribution.**

## Unbiased estimators
**Definition: Unbiased estimator.**

### Why unbiased estimators (usually) aren't important

**Definition: Median unbiased estimator.**

No one talks about median unbiased estimators. Why? Because it's hard to compute them. But they should intuitively be just as attractive as unbiased estimators.
