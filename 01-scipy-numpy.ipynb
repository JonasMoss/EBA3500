        "# Introduction to `Numpy` and `Scipy`\n",
        "\n",
        "In this course we'll several external Python libraries. If you have trouble installing Python locally, you can always use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `Numpy`, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Numpy does all the heavy mathematical lifiting, such as matrix multiplication and summing. We use Numpy due to its *speed* and *convenience*. The syntax of Numpy is very similar to that of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), which is used extensively in heavy-duty machine learning applications.\n",
        "2. `Scipy`, which contains \"fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python\". We will mostly use Scipy for its statistical distributions. \n",
        "3. `Pandas` deals with data frames. Most of our data will be on the Pandas format. \n",
        "4. `statsmodels`. Statsmodels is the Python package for basic statistical analysis in Python. It closely mimics `R` in syntax and functionality.\n",
        "5. `scikit-learn` is somewhat similar to statsmodels, but contains much more functionality and is geared towards [machine learning instead of statistics](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-actual-difference-between-statistics-and-machine-learning-64b49f07ea3). \n",
        "6. `matplotlib`, the basic plotting library in Python.\n",
        "7. `seaborn`. A package that simplifies plotting. \n",
        "8. `tinybench`. Used for doing benchmarks, i.e., timing how long functions take to run. You can learn a lot about how to write efficient code by routinely using this package while coding. It's also quite fun - optimizing code is one of the pleasures of programming, and `tinybench` makes it easy to check if any of your optimizations make sense.\n",

        "We will use Numpy extensively in this course. [Numpy for absolute beginners](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) serves as the main Numpy curriculum. Expect to come back it multiple times! Roughly speaking you're expected to be able to quickly figure out how to solve a given Numpy task in e.g. the home exam, using methods laid out in that document, the Numpy documentation, the lectures, and lecture notes. Take Numpy seriously and do the exercises!\n",
        "\n",
        "Below I write you should *familiarize yourself with* the numpy documentation and how Scipy handles distributions. This means that you should: \n",
        "1. Fire up and instance of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (recommended), Jupyter Notebook, or your prefered way to write Python.\n",
        "2. Go to the supplied links and *actively* read them. You can't just print out the documents and read them in the shade of a tree! You should make an hypothesis about how a snippet of code works, copy the Python code to your editor, and then modify it to check if your hypothesis is true.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python is very slow language. So slow, in fact, that most optimizations in Python is about moving as many computations as possible to Numpy.\n"

        "2. We use the `dtype = np.int64` argument in the `np.arange` function. This makes `int64` the data type of the resulting Numpy array. These are 64 bits (signed) integers, but the standard is 32 bits integer. The difference between these lie in their maximum and minimum values. The maximal value of a 64 bits integer is `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`, but the maximal value of an `i32` is merely `2,147,483,647`. You have to manually specify `i64` when dealing with big integers in Numpy, but you do not need to do that in Python, as it can use integers of arbitrary size (at the cost of speed).\n",
