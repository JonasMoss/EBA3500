# to generate numbers that appear to be uniform.

# This distribution lives on [0, 1] and takes two parameters.

# For example, you may know me as a guy who's pretty fond of the uniform 
# distribution. (And quite fond of the beta(0.5, 0.5)!)

# Big problem: Every vector x has probability 0 under any continuous 
# distribution! Numerically, every vector x just has an incredibly small
# probability, no matter what the true generating distribution is.

# Idea: We know how to approximate the distribution of the mean, assuming the 
# numbers are uniformly distributed. Then we can check if observing a mean as
# large, or larger than, the mean we have observed, is probable or not.
# (We need this "or larger than" since observing a specific mean has probability
# 0 under the uniform distribution)

# say, 0.6, is small. Let's calculate how small it is.

# Can plot these probabilities for every x in the range of the data!

plt.plot(means_sorted, 1 - xs)
plt.show()

# Let's try it on "x":
np.mean(x)
np.mean(means >= np.mean(x)) # 0.078

# But if beta(0.5, 0.5) is the true distribution, we wouldn't expect the means 
# to differ at all!

# On the other hand, the variance of beta(0.5, 0.5) appears to be larger, so
# let's try that one instead.

# The probability of observering such a large variance, provided the true
# generator is uniform, is 0.0028. It's reasonable to think that
# x is not uniformly distributed.

# generator, such as rng.standard_exponential used last time, but use
# rng.random to make it uniform!

# Task (iii). Generate some data from the standard normal distribution and use
# test_rng to test if the data is probable under the normal distribution or not.
# Use the np.mean, np.var, and np.max as the function arguments.
# Task (iv). Suppose you knew that I like beta(9, 9) super-well, but never 
# generate data from beta(0.5, 0.5). How can you modify the variance approach
