We denote the cardinality of a set $A$ as either $\\#A$ or $|A|$, sometimes even $\\textrm{card}A$. The mathematics of cardinality is often concerned with the different sizes of infinity, for instance the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ contains strictly more members than the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$, even though both are infinite.
