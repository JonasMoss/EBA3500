Fall 2022 resources for the BI Norwegian Business School course EBA 3500 Data Analysis with Programming. I will update it continuously throughout the semester.

Got any comments about the course? Or questions about Python and statistics? Feel free to use the [course's Padlet](https://padlet.com/jonasmoss/EBA3500); you can post anonymously there if you want to.

Lecture notes
---
The lecture notes includes exercises, notes the curriculum, and proposed additonal study materials. The lecture plan is tentative.

1. [**Ouverture, Numpy, and some Scipy.**](https://hackmd.io/@JonasMoss/eba3500-lecture01) An introduction to the course, myself, and the backbone of all scientific Python packages, Numpy and Scipy.
2. **Recap and simulation**: We'll start with a recap of the last course and potentially some missing probability material. Simulation is about sampling random variables with a computer, which we will use a lot in this course. 
3. **Simple linear regression.** Simple linear regression is used to model linear relationsships between two variables, the outcome $Y$ and the covariate $X$. This is a heavy lecture, covering concepts that are used repeatedly across the course.
4. **Multiple linear regression.**
5. **Categorical and ordinal covariates.** Categorical covariates are very commonly used in regression analysis. We go through how to handle them and think about them.
6. **Covariate and response transformations, spline modelling** The most common covariate transform is the log-transform, where a covariate / response is transformed from $z$ into $\log z$, but there are infinitely many. We discuss how covariate transforms can be used to fit any univariate curve using splines.
7. **Model fit.** 
8. **Model selection.** 
9. **Binary regression (1).** 
10. **Binary regression (2).**
11. **Decision theory.**
12. **Inference in multiple linear regression.**
13. **Inference for general regression models.**

## Mandatory readings
These documents are mandatory readings, but aren't covered in any of the courses. I recommend you read them at the beginning of the course.
* Be sure to have a look at the [prerequisities](https://hackmd.io/@JonasMoss/eba3500-prerequisites). This document aims to contains a list of the probability you learned last year. We will recap some of this in Lecture 2, but please add comments if there is something you feel haven't bee covered by the previous courses.
* [Getting better at Python](/@JonasMoss/getting-better-at-python) contains some tips for how to become better at Python. It's a mandatory reading.
* The note about [resources and workload](https://hackmd.io/@JonasMoss/eba3500-resources-workload).
