# Resources and workload

### Do the work
This is not a relaxing course. The content is difficult, both in terms of concepts and skills required. Statistics has an unfair and completely untrue reputation as an easy subject. It is not. Those who claim statistics is easy do not know statistics.

Remember that you are expected to work full days as a student. Since you take four courses and all of them, presumably, have approximately $2$ hours of lectures, that leaves $8$ hours of studying -- on your own -- each week.

### Plotting
There will be 

### Resources
You should probably use other resources than the lecture, the lecture notes, the book (which wasn't chosen by me; the administration forced us to choose a book), and the exercises. That is not because these resources do not cover the curriculum. It is because there are 100s of ways to teach the curriculum, and just as many points of view on the difficult parts. You often need to spend significant amounts of time with a concept, looking at it from different angles, in order to finally [grok](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/grokking) it. I did this all the time as a student.

You should search the internet for answers early on. Getting skilled at understanding what to search for is an extremely important skill for life in general, but especially for data science. But the key sites to look at are
* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) The primary resource for programming questions. Often covers statistics and data science questions too. Do not be afraid to ask questions there. 
* [CrossValidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com) The most widely used statistics Q&A site. Most answers are trustworthy, but the answers are often of lower quality than the other pages. Ignore answers that look iffy.
* [Mathematics Stack Exhcange](https://math.stackexchange.com) You use this for math questions. Probably not that useful in this course, but it might come up. 

There is no definite 1st course in Python curriculum, which is a big an unwieldly language. You might not have learned about classes (object-oriented Python) or list comprehensions, or maybe not dictionaries either. I will probably use these concepts without additional explanation.

I would *strongly recommend* you spend 8 hours getting reasonably familiar with object-oriented programming in Python. It is not strictly speaking necessary for this course, as you won't be asked to write your own classes. But some understanding of classes, methods, and attributes will help you understand what's going on, perhaps even to a great degree. There are many resources for this, but
