# Introduction to `Numpy`

In this course we'll several external Python libraries. If you have trouble installing Python locally, you can always use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

1. `Numpy`, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Numpy does all the heavy mathematical lifiting, such as matrix multiplication and summing. We use Numpy due to its *speed* and *convenience*. The syntax of Numpy is very similar to that of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), which is used extensively in heavy-duty machine learning applications.
2. `Pandas` deals with data frames. Most of our data will be on the Pandas format. 
3. `statsmodels`  is the Python package for basic statistical analysis in Python. It closely mimics `R` in syntax and functionality.
4. `scikit-learn` is somewhat similar to statsmodels, but contains much more functionality and is geared towards [machine learning instead of statistics](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-actual-difference-between-statistics-and-machine-learning-64b49f07ea3). 
5. `matplotlib`, the basic plotting library in Python.
6. `seaborn`. A package that simplifies plotting. 
7. `tinybench`. Used for doing benchmarks, i.e., timing how long functions take to run. You can learn a lot about how to write efficient code by routinely using this package while coding. It's also quite fun - optimizing code is one of the pleasures of programming, and `tinybench` makes it easy to check if any of your optimizations make sense.

### The speed of `Numpy`

Python is very slow language. So slow, in fact, that most optimizations in Python is about moving as many computations as possible to Numpy.

The following function sums up all numbers from $1..n$ in vanilla Python.
```{python}
def sum_python(n):
  acc = 0
  for i in range(0, n):
    acc = acc + i
  return acc
```
Make sure you understand what this function does. Can you rewrite it to calculate the product of the $n$ first numbers?

The function below uses Numpy for the same task.
```{python}
import numpy as np
def sum_numpy(n):
  numbers = np.arange(0, n, dtype = np.int64)
  return numbers.sum()
  
```

Here `numbers` is an array of integers (`int64` is a type of integer), and `sum` is one of many Numpy methods that operate on arrays. Unlike Python lists, Numpy arrays are *typed*, and this is a major reason why Numpy is so faster than Python. A Python list can contain just about anything. 

```{python}
ls = [1, "hello", print]
```

Here `ls` contains a number, a string, and a function (actually, a "builtin function"). Recall that you can check the type of an object by calling `type` on it. For instance, we can verify the types above by calling 

```{python}
print([type(x) for x in ls])
```

Let's come back to the matter at hand. We have two implementations of a function that sums the numbers from `1..n`. Both functions return the same value.
```{python}
sum_python(10 ** 6)
```

```{python}
sum_numpy(10 ** 6)
```
Observe that the Numpy code is arguably easier to read. There is no doubt what the `.sum` method does. 

We use the `dtype = np.int64` argument in the `np.arange` function. This makes `int64` the data type of the resulting Numpy array. These are 64 bits (signed) integers, but the standard is 32 bits integer. The difference between these lie in their maximum and minimum values. The maximal value of a 64 bits integer is `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`, but the maximal value of an `i32` is merely `2,147,483,647`. You have to manually specify `i64` when dealing with big integers in Numpy, but you do not need to do that in Python, as it can use integers of arbitrary size, at the cost of speed. You can always find the data type of a Numpy object using the `.dtype` method, e.g.,

```{python}
x = np.arange(0, 10)
x.dtype
```

We compare the execution speed of these functions using the `benchmark` function from the `tinybench` package. As always, type `help(benchmark)` in a Python interpreter to get help for the function. Below, we sample `ntimes = 10` and use a warm up of `10` (to get the processor running). The `g` argument tells `benchmark` where to find the functions in the list, and the argument `globals()` tells it to look at the top level.  
```{python}
from tinybench import benchmark
bench = benchmark(['sum_python(10 ** 6)', 'sum_numpy(10 ** 6)'], ntimes = 100, warmup = 10, g = globals())
bench.plot()
```
The Numpy version is much faster. To pinpoint by exactly how much, we need to look at the mean execution times.
```{python}
bench.means
bench.means['sum_python'] / bench.means['sum_numpy']
```
The Numpy implementation is roughly $10$ times faster. One can expect speedups even larger than this in more complex applications.

## Exercises

### Data types

#### Exercise 1
Figure out the answer the following questions, using e.g. the Numpy documentation. (Look up the functions `iinfo`).

1. What is the minimal value of a 32 bit integer in Numpy? 
2. What is the minimal value of a 64 bit integer in Numpy?
3. Is there an integer type even larger than `int64`, provided you restrict yourself to non-negative numbers, i.e., *unsigned* integers?


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
The first two questions can be answered by 
```{python}
np.iinfo(np.int32)
```

```{python}
np.iinfo(np.int64)
```
For the last question: Yes, the unsigned integers `uint64` are larger.
```{python}
np.iinfo(np.uint64)
```
:::

#### Exercise 2
Decimal numbers in computer science are called *floats*, or floating point numbers. (Look up the functions `finfo`).

1. What types of floats are available in Numpy?
2. What is the default float type when using `linspace`?
3. What are the maximal and minimal values of these float types?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
1. We have `np.float16`, `np.float32` and `np.float64`.
2. Using `np.linspace(0, 1, 4).dtype` we find that `float64` is the default data type.
3. We can read that from the results below:
```{python}
np.finfo(np.float64)
```

### Benchmarking and Numpy

#### Exercise 1
Python implements a method `sum` that sums every member of an *iterable* such as list. Implement a function `sum_python2` that uses `sum` instead of a for-loop, but does not use Numpy. Compare its performance to `sum_python` above. What do you see?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{python}
def sum_python2(n):
  numbers = range(0, n)
  return sum(numbers)

from tinybench import benchmark, benchmark_env
bench = benchmark(['sum_python(10 ** 6)', 'sum_python2(10 ** 6)', 'sum_numpy(10 ** 6)'], ntimes = 100, warmup = 10, g = globals())
bench.plot()  
```
:::


#### Exercise 2
Write a function that squares and sums the numbers from `1` to `n`, one in Numpy and one in pure Python. Roughly how much faster is the Numpy implementation than the Python implementation when using `n=1000`, `n=10000`, or `n=10**6`? (*Hint*: Make sure to use a Numpy function to square all the elements!)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{python}
def sum_sq_python(n):
  numbers = range(0, n)
  acc = 0
  for i in numbers:
    acc = acc + i**2
  return acc

def sum_sq_numpy(n):
  numbers = np.arange(0, n, dtype = np.int64)
  return np.square(numbers).sum()

from tinybench import benchmark, benchmark_env
bench = benchmark(['sum_sq_python(10 ** 6)', 'sum_sq_numpy(10 ** 6)'], ntimes = 100, warmup = 10, g = globals())
bench.plot()  
```
```{python}
bench.means['sum_sq_python'] / bench.means['sum_sq_numpy']
```
:::

#### Exercise 3
Recall that the sample variance is defined as $\sum (x_i - \overline{x})^2 / (n-1)$, where $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean and $n$ is the number of observations. Compare a Numpy-free implantation to the `var` method of `Numpy` (using the optional argument `ddof = 1`.), on the numbers from `1 .. 10 ** 5`, but this time, let `dtype = float64`. Be sure to check that your functions return the same result!

(*Note*: You algorithm and `Numpy` might give different results for very large `n`. This is due to a phenomenon called [numerical instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_stability), which we ignore in this course.)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Solution
```{python}
def var_python(n):
  numbers = range(0, n)
  mean = sum(numbers) / n
  return sum([(x - mean) ** 2 for x in numbers]) / (n - 1)

def var_numpy(n):
  numbers = np.arange(0, n, dtype = np.float64)
  return numbers.var(ddof = 1)
```

```{python}
var_numpy(10**5)
```
```{python}
var_python(10**5)
```

### Numpy exercises

#### Exercise 1
How do you do the following in Numpy? Make sure to make your own example in Python!
    1. Make an identity matrix with `n` rows?
    2. Make a matrix consisting of $0$s only?
    3. Calculate the empirical mean of a vector? 
    4. Calculate the standard deviation of a vector normalized so that the variance is unbiased? (*Hint:* Read the Numpy documentation to find out what I mean!) Which of these do you think we are most interested in in this course?
    5. Calculate "cumulative sum" operation on a vector `x`? (This operation creates a new vector `y` whose first element is `x[0]`, second `x[0] + x[1]`, etc.)
    6. Take the element-wise logarithm of a matrix?

#### Exercise 5
The Github repo [Numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100) contains 100 Numpy exercises of variable difficulty. The Github page also includes hints and solutions. You can read the 100 problems [here](https://hackmd.io/@JonasMoss/numpy-100). Do **exercises 1 - 11 in** this repo. There is no upper limit to how many of the `numpy-100` you should do, but I would recommend you do as many as you can find time for. (These exercises are pretty short!) The point is to [*grok*](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/grok) Numpy. (*Hint:* Use the Numpy documentation, Google, StackExchange, and so on. Check the hints if you have to.)
